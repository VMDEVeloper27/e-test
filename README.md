|   |– js/
|   |   |– scripts.min.js

|   |– js/
|   |   |– scripts.js

```

**Disclaimer:** root file style.css can be left empty, only comment with theme registration.

## Result

The result of the task will need to be pushed on [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) to the public repository. The desirable deadline is 4-6 hours from the date of receipt of the assignment. You do not need to send any ZIP archives or file sets as a response. All your responses must be pushed to GIT repository as a folder with a theme you created.

You only send a link to your repository to serhii@ecomitize.com and julius@ecomitize.com. If you don't have an account yet, this is a good reason to start one.
